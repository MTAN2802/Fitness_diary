# Fitness_diary

This website serves to track my fitness activities for each day and store the activity, length of time, and calories burned within a database. The home page will have a checkbox list for the main exercises I do, and an "other" option for any extra activities. Once submitted, it will link to another page that will generate a table based on the activities selected. The data filled within this table will be saved as a JSON object with JavaScript, and then transformed and loaded to postgresql using Python
